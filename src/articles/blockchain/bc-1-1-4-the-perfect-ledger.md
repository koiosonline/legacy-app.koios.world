# BC-1-1-4-The-perfect-ledger

So now you have seen and possibly already understand that humanity keeps striving to improve its current ledger. You might have noticed; the same goes for other topics. We are quite the inventive species (imagination!). We need to define what a "perfect" version is in our thrive towards perfection. That is what this session is all about!

>💡 **Summarized: a perfect ledger had NO (!) "transaction costs". There is no friction when transacting.**

Like a delay, some threshold or fee is created by some form of limitation. The limitation can be a physical wall a few centuries ago that prevented you from trading. Like a castle wall. Or a digital wall age that prevents you from seeing the data that other entities can see. These limitations create opportunities for intermediaries, which can manage these limitations (like a gatekeeper)—often creating benefits for some individuals (castle owners) but losing tremendous value for others.

>💡 **Time has shown us that walls are relatively primitive tools. As a result, they don't work as well as they used to. So we are moving away from the idea of walls and moving towards more open inter-connected environments—examples: platform economies, sharing economies, and open-source software.**

So what does this mean? Let's look at some of the papers' properties and shown on the slides. In a perfect ledger, the recording of transactions should be done instantly. So let's use the example with you as a bookkeeper. In this example, the first "cost" related to instant recording property is that you need some time because you first need to witness the transactions and then record them. Also, other costs arise, in this case, because you run a centralized ledger like the risk of making errors, (un)willingly. I think you understand by now that we are far from perfect in this example.

So what is a perfect ledger? A perfect ledger mimics the exact physical and digital world (and therefore has no transaction costs). So transactions are instantly recorded, there are no trusted intermediaries creating limitations. No thresholds, no friction, to make a trade. You will discover many, many shortcomings in our current ledgers. Although an upgrade in technology, there are also still many shortcomings! To give you a scope of the idea, reaching perfection might never even happen. But since Satoshi Nakamoto, duck-duck-go that one, Pandora's box has been opened. Developments in this technology have rapidly increased. Who knows what significant improvements we'll see in the next decade 😃!

Our strive towards the perfect ledger brought us many improvements. They are a lot lighter nowadays. Imagine walking around with a clay tablet instead of a phone: faster transactions, more connections, new societies. You can also record more on our current ledgers, compare a USB stick with a paper book. And while we've been continuously growing towards that perfect ledger, we keep letting societies grow with it. And like mentioned before, the other way around is because sometimes society demands a new form. We face many global challenges, best tackled by secure international administrations without intermediaries.

So in the next slide, you see an overview of the perfect ledger with its properties. I think you caught the gist so far on this introductory level. But suppose you want to learn more about possible future economies. In that case, I highly recommend reading the further readings of this section.

>💡 **A blockchain is far from the perfect ledger. It is "just" another big step towards that perfection. However, keep in mind that history has shown that societal structures change every Time the ledger improves.**

<blockquote style="border-color: #ff0bac"> **❓ What limitations do you think there will be in a blockchain? I know this is hard to think about in this phase, but dare to challenge the grey mass we call a brain :-)! ** </blockquote>

And we are in dire need of that. Why? We will see in the subsequent two sessions where we discuss the shortcomings of our current centralized ledgers. 

## Conclusion
A perfect ledger has no transaction costs. Transaction cost can be seen as a "friction" that limits entities when transferring value. Examples of this friction are fee, time/delays, lack of transparency, accessibility, etc. So what is a perfect ledger? It mimics the exact real physical and digital world (no transaction costs/frictions). Our strive to improve has brought us many improvements. Keep in mind that a blockchain is far from perfect. It is "just" another (big) step towards that perfection.

## 📖🖋 Homework assignment 
Compare your answers about "what do you think a perfect ledger is" with what you have learned in this lesson. For example, were you close? Did you miss something? And do you agree with the perfect ledger that was described in the paper discussed in this lesson? Again, remain critical but constructive.
